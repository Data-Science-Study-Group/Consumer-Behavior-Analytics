olist_order_items_dataset - there are more total rows than the other files, my guess is because every single ordered product has it's own row.
^^while other files have the entire order as its own row.


Process:
Copied over order_items_data_set
copied over columns product_id and product_category name from olist_products_dataset
Made a new column for product_category name with both product_id columns.
Copied over product_category_name and then did a vlookup to translate.
